# Systems-Analysis-Design


# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a mixed-delivery learning agency for prospective licensees for driving in any of the 50 states in the USA. They desired a system such that they can provide online learning content as well as schedule driving instruction sessions with driving instructors they employ.

# What did you do particularly well?
Created UML diagrams and written material to convey a system that would properly solve for client needs.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would probably revise the sequence diagram to more properly demonstrate certain relationships.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user wants a modern, cloud-based, multi-platform solution to increasing sales and efficiency in tandem.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I would begin by recording a meeting with the client and ensure I have captured all requirements. Then, I would build a system to meet those requirements in a secure and proficient way.
